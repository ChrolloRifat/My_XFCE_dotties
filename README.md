# DOTFILES OF MY XFCE SETUP

The GTK theme as well as the kvantume theme used here are a fork of https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme. I thank Vinceliuice for creating such wonderful themes. Um, yes, there's no window buttons (i.e. minimize, close) and application title in the wm theme, because I use a keyboard-driven workflow
