# DOTFILES OF MY XFCE SETUP

The GTK theme used here is a fork of https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme and the Xfwm theme is a fork of https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections/tree/master/2bxfwm-Lucy/xfwm4 . I thank them for creating such wonderful themes. Um, yes, there's no window buttons (i.e. minimize, close) and application title in the wm theme, because I use a keyboard-driven workflow

# Description:

Xfce version: 4.16<br>
Wallpaper: Collected from Unixporn<br>
Widget: Conky<br>
Icon theme: Tela-Dark<br>
Font: Cantarell<br>
I recommend you to use this package for enabling this wm theme in CSD applications also: https://github.com/PCMan/gtk3-nocsd<br>
And remember, this theme is for keyboard-driven workflows, which means there's no taskbar buttons. Make sure to bind shortcuts to each commands<br>
