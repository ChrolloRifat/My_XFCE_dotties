# blu-xfce-theme
So, I'm somewhat a ricer and I thought, why not patch a theme for myself? Why not? That's why I've made this fork of Matcha-dark-azul GTK theme + This https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections/tree/master/2bxfwm-Lucy/xfwm4 xfwm theme, but with a slightly darker color. This is for my personal use, but feel free to give me suggestions :D
