# blu-xfce-theme

This GTK theme is a fork of https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme and the Xfwm theme is a fork of https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections/tree/master/2bxfwm-Lucy/xfwm4 . I thank them for creating such wonderful themes

# What is this thing?

Nothing, another GTK theme which is modified for Xfce. Um, yes, there's no window buttons (i.e. minimize, close) and application title in the wm theme, because I use a keyboard-driven workflow

Bonus: There's a conky config for four different things also

# Description:

Xfce version: 4.16

Wallpaper: From Windows 11

Widget: Conky

Icon theme: Fluent-dark

Font: Quicksand

I recommend you to use this package for enabling this wm theme in CSD applications also: https://github.com/PCMan/gtk3-nocsd

And remember, this theme is for keyboard-driven workflows, which means there's no taskbar buttons. Make sure to bind shortcuts to each commands

I'm sorry for uploading .zip files, I had lack of time... so....
